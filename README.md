# DDoS-attacks-classification-Machine-learning

A classification system that leverages supervised learning techniques to identify and mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. By training models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks on labeled network traffic data, the system can accurately distinguish between normal and malicious activity.
